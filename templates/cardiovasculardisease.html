            In 2014-15, approximately 4.2 million Australian adults (18.3%) reported having a disease of the
            circulatory system, including around 1.2 million people with cardiovascular conditions such as
            stroke and heart disease. Approximately 2.6 million Australians reported having hypertension
            (high blood pressure) and 430,000 indicated that they had experienced a heart attack at some
            point in their life.<sup>1</sup>
            Cardiovascular disease is the leading
            cause of death in Australia. In 2017, 43,000 (27%) of deaths had an underlying cause of
            cardiovascular disease.<sup>2</sup>

            What is Cardiovascular Disease?
        </h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a collective term for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
            The term commonly includes diseases such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, cardiomyopathy,
            congenital heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and stroke. Many of these conditions can be
            life-threatening.

            Types of CVDs
        </h1>
        <h1>Coronary Heart Disease</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Coronary heart disease (CHD) develops when the coronary arteries become too narrow.
            The coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply oxygen and blood to the heart.
            Coronary heart disease can cause angina pectoris and can also cause shortness of breath.
            According to statistics, an estimated 580,300 Australians aged 18 and over
            (3% of the adult population) reported having coronary heart disease. Of the people
            with coronary heart disease, 227,300 have experienced angina.<sup>3</sup>
        </p>
        <h1>Stroke</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Stroke is usually an acute event, mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from
            flowing to the heart or brain, or it may be caused by bleeding from blood vessels or
            blood clots in the brain. According to a statistic, in 2015, approximately 394,000
            Australians (1.7% of the population) experienced a stroke in their lives. It is more
            common in the elderly population — over two in three (67%) people who had a stroke were
            aged 65 and over. According to hospital and mortality data, there were an estimated
            37,800 strokes in Australia in 2016, more than 100 per day.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <h1>Heart Failure</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Heart failure is sometimes called congestive heart failure, meaning the heart cannot pump
            blood properly around the body. It usually occurs because the heart becomes too weak or stiff.
            It can happen at any age, but it is most common in the elderly.
        </p>
        <h1>Congenital Heart Disease</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Congenital heart disease is a general term for a range of birth defects that affect the
            normal way the heart works. The latest data show that more than 2,000 babies suffer from
            congenital heart disease every year — 8 in every 1,000 live births.<sup>2</sup> Among
            babies born in Australia (excluding the Northern Territory) in 2003, there were 1675
            cases of congenital heart disease most frequently reported.<sup>4</sup>
