            In 2014-15, approximately 4.2 million Australian adults (18.3%) reported having a disease of the 
            circulatory system, including around 1.2 million people with cardiovascular conditions such as 
            stroke and heart disease. Approximately 2.6 million Australians reported having hypertension 
            (high blood pressure) and 430,000 indicated that they had experienced a heart attack at some 
            point in their life.
            Cardiovascular disease is the leading
            cause of death in Australia. In 2015, 45,392 (29%) of deaths had an underlying cause of cardiovascular disease.
            Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors
            such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of
            alcohol using population-wide strategies.
            People with cardiovascular disease or high-risk cardiovascular disease (due to the
            presence of one or more risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
            or established diseases), need to use counseling and drugs for early detection and
            management as appropriate.

            your risk of cardiovascular disease and take care of your overall wellbeing.</p>
